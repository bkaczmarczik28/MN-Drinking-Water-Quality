# Minnesota Drinking Water Quality Analysis
Who in Minnesota has access to safe drinking water? This project determined whether there is a relationship between Minnesotaâ€™s drinking water quality and poverty rates in each county

### Data Manipulation
Three contaminant levels in municipal water supplies throughout the state in 2017 were selected from the EPA database. Poverty rates by county from (database) were sorted in descending order and binned into five groups. The following two questions were addressed:

1. Is there a significance difference between the mean concentration of a particular contaminant in a group compared to another?

2. Is there a significance difference between the mean concentration of a particular contaminant in the wealthiest counties compared to the poorest?
